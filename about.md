## About me

Hello, I'm Richard Nieding.

I dream of an [Ã‰rard](https://www.greifenberger-institut.de/dt/wissenswertes/besaitete-tasteninstrumente/fortepiano-nach-1800/erard.php) grand piano at night, love playing the piano, playing e-bass and going mountain biking during the day.

### Content of the pages

This is mainly a place for me where I document things (IT & music) and thoughts about projects that I have had in the past or that I have at the moment. However, it may also include some code snippets and personal cheat sheets that I developed during my journey.

### About the website

Some facts about this website:

- Built for Jekyll
- Using the amazing Dark Poole theme

### PS

Have questions about anything - or a suggestion for a weird music record? Feel free to contact me via zeppeh\at\icloud\com

Go into the forest!
