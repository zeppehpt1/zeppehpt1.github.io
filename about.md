Welcome to the way of zeppeh - the iddqd astronaut's path to infinite knowledge. This is mainly a place for me where I document things and thoughts about projects that I have had in the past or that I have at the moment. However, it may also include some code snippets and personal cheat sheets that I developed during my journey. For you, it could be a place to read about things that are interesting to you, or in the best case, even help you with your own project.

Some facts about this website:

- Built for Jekyll
- Using the amazing Dark Poole theme

Have questions or suggestions about anything? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zeppehh).

Go to the forest!
